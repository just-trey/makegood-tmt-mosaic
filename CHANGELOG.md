# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Prevented the app from crashing on startup when the build-time version token
  was unavailable, which was causing the Playwright smoke check to time out.
- Assembly artwork on a +Y-facing design face (e.g. the wheel's default face)
  loaded mirrored left-to-right, so text read backwards. Placement now
  auto-corrects per face so artwork is right-reading by default, viewed from
  that face's front, on any face and in both modes.

### Added

- **Flip H / Flip V** mirror toggles in Artwork fit, layered on top of the
  automatic orientation — for artwork you deliberately want mirrored, or a
  design meant to be read from the back of a face. Reset with "Reset to
  auto-fit".
- Cloudflare Web Analytics on the hosted page (cookieless, no personal data
  collected). The beacon is injected at build time only when `CF_BEACON_TOKEN`
  is set, so forks build and deploy without it. See `.env.example`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Assembly mode's wheel **Cap** part: the design was clipped to whatever small
  flat patch got auto-detected as its face (~16.35mm radius), leaving an
  uncut collar around the rest of the domed ~18.4mm cap instead of covering
  the whole curved top. The cut now spans the part's full curved surface,
  fixed to a 3mm depth matching the cap's shell thickness above its
  mounting boss so the clamp fit stays intact.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

Initial public alpha. Baseline feature set as of this release:

### Added

- SVG-to-3MF color-inlay pipeline: parses `<path>`/`<rect>`/`<circle>`/etc.
  geometry directly, groups shapes by fill color, and computes each color's
  net visible region (paint order aware) via 2D polygon booleans.
- **Flat-plate mode**: builds a stack of flat slabs between depth boundaries.
- **Assembly mode**: cuts pockets into real part meshes via Manifold (WASM
  CSG), including support for rotated-copy parts.
- Print-ready Bambu Studio 3MF export — parts placed on build plates, each
  recess pre-named and pre-assigned to its detected color's filament slot.
- Per-color STL export as a fallback for other slicers.
- Automatic boolean-failure recovery: vertex deduplication, degenerate-sliver
  scrubbing, and reduced-precision retries for self-intersecting source paths.
