## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Assembly mode's wheel **Cap** part: the design was clipped to whatever small
  flat patch got auto-detected as its face (~16.35mm radius), leaving an
  uncut collar around the rest of the domed ~18.4mm cap instead of covering
  the whole curved top. The cut now spans the part's full curved surface,
  fixed to a 3mm depth matching the cap's shell thickness above its
  mounting boss so the clamp fit stays intact.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

Initial public alpha. Baseline feature set as of this release:

### Added

- SVG-to-3MF color-inlay pipeline: parses `<path>`/`<rect>`/`<circle>`/etc.
  geometry directly, groups shapes by fill color, and computes each color's
  net visible region (paint order aware) via 2D polygon booleans.
- **Flat-plate mode**: builds a stack of flat slabs between depth boundaries.
- **Assembly mode**: cuts pockets into real part meshes via Manifold (WASM
  CSG), including support for rotated-copy parts.
- Print-ready Bambu Studio 3MF export — parts placed on build plates, each
  recess pre-named and pre-assigned to its detected color's filament slot.
- Per-color STL export as a fallback for other slicers.
- Automatic boolean-failure recovery: vertex deduplication, degenerate-sliver
  scrubbing, and reduced-precision retries for self-intersecting source paths.
